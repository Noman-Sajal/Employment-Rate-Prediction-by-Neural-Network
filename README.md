Employment Rate Prediction Based on Economic Indicators: An Interactive Analysis with Neural Network Modelling (Final year project)

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting employment rates for over 150 countries using economic indicators such as GDP, Inflation, Labor Force Participation Rate, Population Growth, and Trade. The goal is to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict employment rates for the years 2023 to 2025 using historical data from 2000 to 2022.

Project Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and relationships.
Use ARIMA models to forecast input features for 2023–2025.
Train and evaluate the following machine learning models:
Linear Regression
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
XGBoost
Random Forest (Default and Hyperparameter Tuned)
Compare model performance using metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Accuracy (%)
Create an interactive dashboard and a world map visualization to display:
Predicted employment rates for 2023–2025.
Employment rate trends by country and continent.
